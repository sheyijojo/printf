### 0x11. C - printf

This project involves re-writing the `printf` function as it is in C language, it extensively tests our knowledge so far in the **ALX LOW-LEVEL PROGRAMMING**. This project is a collaboration by **Gaji Sheyi** and **Tubi Michael**.

## DESCRIPTION

- The function `_printf` writes output to stdout. The function writes under the control of a `format` string that specifies how subsequent arguments (accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of standard library `stdarg`) are converted for output.

- Prototype: `int _printf(const char *format, ...);`

## RETURN

-  Upon success, `_printf` returns the number of characters printed (**excluding the terminating null byte used to end output to strings**). If an output error is encountered, the function returns `-1`.

## COLLABORATORS

- This project is a put together by **Gaji Sheyi** and **Tubi Michael**.
